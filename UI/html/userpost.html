                    <p>Amending the array for every single use of the function is not optimal for the amount of data that I
                        will be processing, and I'd like to find some way to have a name definition that automatically populates
                        the arrays (perhaps by searching the I column for a specific value) or VBA function that populates
                        the row numbers based on input cells. I have tried a few different solutions based on searching for
                        various functions, but I haven't been able to come up with a winning combination. Is there a better
                        way to programatically populate the array values when the length is different for each function run?

                    <p>I have a table of events. Each events has a date. My API requires that I return at least X events before/after
                        a certain date, but I must return all the events for each date. If I did this in code I'd do something
                        like group the events by date and sorted ascending/descending then take enough days such that I have
                        at least 50 events. This is what I have so far: .... FROM "events" WHERE (date in ( SELECT DISTINCT
                        date FROM events WHERE DATE
                        2 018-08-12 ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 50) However it only returns a 16 events even though there are many more in the DB.
                            I think that for this to work I need to do something like getting the count of events per day and
                            then getting enough days such that the sum of events>= X (eg. 50) and then return the actual events. Is that how to do it? And how should such a query
                            be written correctly?

                    <p>After having implemented some logic with 32-bit bit vectors using uint, I found that there already exists
                        a BitVector32 inside System.Collections.Specialized. The thing is, it uses int for its API and does
                        casts to uint internally, along with some other checking in other cases. Is there any case when one
                        could run into issues combining these three options? Are are they completely interchangable apart
                        from not having a subscript API on int/uint?
